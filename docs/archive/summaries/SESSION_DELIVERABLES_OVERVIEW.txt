7. KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

FORCE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:

Original (427K): R²=0.9958
  → Excellent force prediction accuracy
  → 9.61° mean angular error (very accurate directions)
  → Production-ready for MD simulations
  → Recommendation: Deploy immediately

Tiny (77K): R²=0.3787
  → Moderate force prediction capability
  → 48.63° mean angular error (significant direction error)
  → Not suitable for current MD use without improvement
  → Recommendation: Improve architecture (hidden_dim 64→96, add interactions)

Ultra-tiny (21K): R²=0.1499
  → Very poor force prediction
  → 82.34° mean angular error (unreliable directions)
  → Energy predictions may be acceptable
  → Recommendation: Restrict to energy-only applications

COMPRESSION TRADE-OFF:
  Original:     1.0x compression, 0.9958 R² (production-grade)
  Tiny:         5.5x compression, 0.3787 R² (needs improvement)
  Ultra-tiny:  19.9x compression, 0.1499 R² (energy-only)

12. SESSION CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This session successfully completed the compact models force analysis task
with comprehensive deliverables and clear strategic guidance.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
✅ Analyzed three student models against Orb teacher
✅ Generated publication-quality force comparison visualizations
✅ Identified Original model as production-ready
✅ Documented limitations of Tiny and Ultra-tiny models
✅ Created comprehensive improvement roadmap
✅ Provided clear next steps with timelines

The Original model (427K parameters, R²=0.9958) is ready for immediate
deployment. Tiny and Ultra-tiny models require further optimization or
restriction to appropriate use cases.

All documentation is comprehensive, well-organized, and committed to the
repository. The next team has clear guidance on priorities and implementation
approach.
