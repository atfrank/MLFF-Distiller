## Use Case Recommendations

Based on the validation results, the Tiny Model (77K parameters) is recommended for:

**Fast Screening Applications**: The model shows acceptable stability but elevated
energy drift. Suitable for rapid screening applications where speed is prioritized
over long-term accuracy.

Recommended applications:
- Initial structure screening
- Rough energy ranking
- Quick conformational searches
- Pre-filtering before higher-accuracy calculations

NOT recommended for:
- Long timescale dynamics
- Quantitative free energy calculations
- Property predictions requiring strict energy conservation

## Comparison with Original Model (427K)

The original student model (Issue #33) achieved:
- Energy drift: 0.02% - 0.40% (all passed <1%)
- 100% pass rate on standard criteria

The Tiny Model (77K parameters, 5.5x compression) shows:
- Mean energy drift: 0.92%
- Pass rate (standard): 33%
- Pass rate (extended): 100%

This degradation is expected given the force R^2 = 0.3787 (vs ~0.9+ for original).
